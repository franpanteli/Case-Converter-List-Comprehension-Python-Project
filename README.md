# Case-Converter-List-Comprehension-Python-Project
### About This Repository
I independently completed freeCodeCampâ€™s [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification, to invest in my scientific computing skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work, as part of the fourth project in this curriculum. The two scripts I devised as part of this both define a function, to convert Pascal or camel case strings into snake case. The first method used to achieve this applies a for loop, contained in the project [1 without-list-comprehension.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Case-Converter-List-Comprehension-Python-Project/blob/main/1%20without-list-comprehension.py) file. The second approach for this applies a list comprehension rather than a for loop, in the project [2 with-list-comprehension.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Case-Converter-List-Comprehension-Python-Project/blob/main/2%20with-list-comprehension.py) file. These .py files are annotated with in-depth problem solving approaches, and my [problem solving thought process notes](https://github.com/franpanteli/Case-Converter-List-Comprehension-Python-Project/blob/main/List%20Comprehension%20Problem%20Solving%20Thought%20Process%20Notes.txt) contain more information about their theory. This allowed me to invest in my list comprehension and function-writing skills with Python, marking the successful completion of the fourth project in the certification.
