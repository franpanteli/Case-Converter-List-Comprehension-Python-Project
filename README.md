# Case-Converter-List-Comprehension-Python-Project
### About This Repository
I independently completed freeCodeCampâ€™s [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification, to invest in my scientific computing skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work, as part of the fourth project in this curriculum. The two scripts I devised as part of this defined a function, which converted Pascal or camel case strings into snake case. This was implemented with two approaches. The method used to achieve this did so by using a for loop and is contained in the project [1 without-list-comprehension.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Case-Converter-List-Comprehension-Python-Project/blob/main/1%20without-list-comprehension.py) file. The second approach used to write this function used a list comprehension and is contained in the project [2 with-list-comprehension.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Case-Converter-List-Comprehension-Python-Project/blob/main/2%20with-list-comprehension.py) file. These .py files are annotated with in-depth problem-solving approaches, and my [list comprehension problem-solving thought process notes](https://github.com/franpanteli/Case-Converter-List-Comprehension-Python-Project/blob/main/2%20with-list-comprehension.py) contain more information about the theory behind them. This aided in developing my list comprehension and function-writing skills with Python, marking the successful completion of the fourth project in the certification.
